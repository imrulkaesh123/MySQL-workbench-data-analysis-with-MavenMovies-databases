# MySQL-workbench-data-analysis-with-MavenMovies-databases
In this course, l will play the role of a business owner who just acquired Maven Movies, a brick and mortar DVD rental shop. Using only a MySQL database and MySQL Workbench, your mission is to learn everything that you can about your new business; including your inventory, staff, and customer behavior.
Sure, here's the rewritten paragraph:

**Case Study:**
The insurance policy of Maven Movies is due for renewal. The underwriters of the insurance company require updated information from Maven Movies before they can issue a new policy.

**Objective:**
The goal is to utilize SQL skills to retrieve and analyze data from different tables in the Maven Movies database. This is done to answer the questions posed by the insurance underwriters. Each question can be addressed by querying a single table. Part of the analysis involves determining which table to use.

The project workflow is based on the key questions that the insurance underwriters need answered:
- A list of all staff members is required, including their first and last names, email addresses, and the identification number of the store where they work.
- Separate counts of inventory items held at each of the two stores are needed.
- A count of active customers for each store is required, separately.
- To assess the liability of a data breach, a count of all customer email addresses stored in the database is needed.
- The diversity of the film offering is of interest as a means of understanding future customer engagement. A count of unique film titles in inventory at each store and a count of the unique categories of films provided are required.
- Understanding the replacement cost of the films is important. The replacement cost for the least expensive film to replace, the most expensive film to replace, and the average of all films carried is needed.
- Implementing payment monitoring systems and maximum payment processing restrictions to minimize future fraud risk by staff is of interest. The average payment processed and the maximum payment processed are required.
- A better understanding of the customer base is desired. A list of all customer identification values, with a count of all-time rentals they have made, with the highest volume customers at the top of the list, is required.
